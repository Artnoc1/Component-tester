# Component-tester
Component tester for Arduino:

Test many types of semiconductors, resistors, capacitors, inductors, etc.

Based on Ardutester and earlier works. Uses the ButtonCtl Arduino library (in this repository). Includes hardware design schematic and PCB layout in Eagle format.
The DUT inputs are relay protected against charged capacitors being inserted.
Do not connect batteries or super capacitors.
